Add the future works here so that I can update it later

-> Deleting the node function
    --> Adding a verification loc that first verifies if what you are looking for does exist in the map or not
-> (optional) - adding more elements in the data part of the node
    --> for this I guess I have to create a specific key to allot a space
-> check for cache redudancy (keeping track of it)
-> later down the line check for search algorithms
-> 
-> Create an importable Package to use easily
